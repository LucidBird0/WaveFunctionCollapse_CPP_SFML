# WaveFunctionCollapse_CPP_SFML
A, probably, not very good example of WaveFuntionCollapse in C++, UI based on SFML.

(The .exe is just the .cpp file built.)
To run:
Donwnload the .exe file and the "images" folder and put them in the same directory.
Open the .exe file.


Note:
There is plenty of room for implementations.
I'm not an expert. I try my best as i learn.
